  description: |
    Distfit is a python package for probability density fitting across
     89 univariate distributions to non-censored data by residual sum of
     squares (RSS), and hypothesis testing. Probability density fitting
     is the fitting of a probability distribution to a series of data
     concerning the repeated measurement of a variable phenomenon.
     Distfit scores each of the 89 different distributions for the fit
     with the empirical distribution and return the best scoring
     distribution.
