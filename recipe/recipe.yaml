  summary: Probability density function fitting and hypothesis testing.

  description: |
    Distfit is a python package for probability density fitting across
    89 univariate distributions to non-censored data by residual sum of
    squares (RSS), and hypothesis testing. Probability density fitting
    is the fitting of a probability distribution to a series of data
    concerning the repeated measurement of a variable phenomenon.
    Distfit scores each of the 89 different distributions for the fit
    with the empirical distribution and return the best scoring
    distribution.
